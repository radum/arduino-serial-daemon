make
=====================
 
 Used for my PiBot. PiBot is written in python which makes a bit slow, so I'm trying to make a C version that hopefully will perform better.
 
 Daemon that listens and sends data thru serial interface to arduino. 
 Use WASD to move the camera pan tilt on the car and arrows to move the car. Raspberry pi is used with uv4l-raspicam to stream from the camera to your browser.
 
 Still work in progress
